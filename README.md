# About The Code

The code that I accepted is not too bad, I have tried to analyze the code from the Controller, Repository and also Test unit, everything looks fine. But yes of course there is a few things that I have to fix the code, from unused functions/methods, commented scripts, style code, and I tried to separated a few code into another repository.

I have created a new repository named NotificationRepository to separated functions/methods like notification functions, to avoid too much code in one class of BookingRepository. If we could group a specific function into another class, that would be even better. Actually I would try to move another code into Helper class (new class) but looks like I do not have any time to do it. So I am just done with what I have said above before.

The code is about User to book a translator who will help translate the language and it would be notified to the translator by email or SMS about the order.
